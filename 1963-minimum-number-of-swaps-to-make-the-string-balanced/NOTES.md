1. my approach using hint:
count the number of opening brackets and closing brackets if at any given point of time the closing brackets become more than opening brackets swap it with the last opening bracket as it would be most sensible to do so as last opening bracket is least usefull
2. stack approach:
if there is a incorrect bracket then increment it and return the number of incorrect bracket + /2 as to correct two incorrect bracket it takes one swap
